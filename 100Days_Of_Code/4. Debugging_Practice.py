# Print Statement 1 is missing double quote at start of print statement
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")

# Print Statement 2 has double quote inside double quote so fix could be use of escape character
# or using single quote for main print statement
print("String Concatenation is done with the \"+\" sign.")
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')

# Print Statement 3 has indentation error which could be fixed by backspace / refactor code
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')

# Print Statement 4 has extra parenthesis
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
